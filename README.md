# Toontown Rewritten Launcher Reengineering

**Toontown Rewritten Launcher Reengineering** is a reengineering of the Toontown Rewritten Source Code found inside of the [TTR Flatpak](https://www.xytime.xyz/flatpaks/ttr/index.html). Not trying to do anything malicious here the entire launcher is owned by Toontown Rewritten Team just found it interesting they didnt compile it for the flatpak.

# Notice by Darth :

This is an unofficial launcher and I am not affiliated with Toontown Rewritten, all assets are owned by TTR , except my modified code and additions.
Please note: This launcher has a remember me feature, this is stored in plaintext , I am not responsible if you lose your account. If you are worried  feel free  to enable toonstep / 2 factor authentication as it will help protect your account.

# What is new in this launcher fork? By Darth:
This launcher has native support for apple silicon as I upgraded it from qt5 to qt6! It also has the other benefits associated with qt6 like wayland support. There is  also a remember me checkbox just like the current-day TTR launcher. I plan to add more new features like the invasion tracker from the mac launcher and sound effects.
